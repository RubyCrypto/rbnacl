  # Cryptographic hash functions
  #
  # Cryptographic hash functions take a variable length message and compute a
  # fixed length string, the message digest. Even a small change in the input
  # data should produce a large change in the digest, and it is 'very difficult'
  # to create two messages with the same digest.
  #
  # A cryptographic hash can be used for checking the integrity of data, but
  # there is no secret involved in the hashing, so anyone can create the hash of
  # a given message.
  #
  # RbNaCl provides the SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash functions.
