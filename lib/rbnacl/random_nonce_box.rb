module RbNaCl
  # The simplest nonce strategy that could possibly work
  #
  # This class implements the simplest possible nonce generation strategy to
  # wrap a RbNaCl::Box or RbNaCl::SecretBox.  A 24-byte random nonce is used
  # for the encryption and is prepended to the message.  When it is time to
  # open the box, the message is split into nonce and ciphertext, and then the
  # box is decrypted.
  #
  # Thanks to the size of the nonce, the chance of a collision is negligible.  For
  # example, after encrypting 2^64 messages, the odds of their having been
  # repeated nonce is approximately 2^-64.  As an additional convenience, the
  # ciphertexts may be encoded or decoded by any of the encoders implemented in
  # the library.
  #
  # The resulting ciphertexts are 40 bytes longer than the plain text (24 byte
  # nonce plus a 16 byte authenticator).  This might be annoying if you're
  # encrypting tweets, but for files represents a fairly small overhead.
  #
  # Some caveats:
  #
  # * If your random source is broken, so is the security of the messages.  You
  #   have bigger problems than just this library at that point, but it's worth
  #   saying.
  # * The confidentiality of your messages is assured with this strategy, but
  #   there is no protection against messages being reordered and replayed by an
  #   active adversary.
