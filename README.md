A Ruby binding to the state-of-the-art [Networking and Cryptography][nacl]
library by Daniel J. Bernstein. This is **NOT** Google Native Client. This
is a crypto library.

On a completely unrelated topic, RbNaCl is also the empirical formula for
Rubidium Sodium Chloride.

## Why NaCl?

NaCl is a different kind of cryptographic library. In the past crypto
libraries were kitchen sinks of little bits and pieces, like ciphers,
MACs, signature algorithms, and hash functions. To accomplish anything
you had to make a lot of decisions about which specific pieces to use,
and if any of your decisions were wrong, the result was an insecure
system. The choices are also not easy: EAX? GCM? CCM? AES-CTR? CMAC?
OMAC1? AEAD? NIST? CBC? CFB? CTR? ECB? OMGWTFBBQ!

NaCl puts cryptography on Rails! Instead of making you choose which
cryptographic primitives to use, NaCl provides convention over configuration
in the form of expertly-assembled high-level cryptographic APIs that ensure
not only the confidentiality of your data, but also detect tampering.
These high-level, easy-to-use APIs are designed to be hard to attack by
default in ways primitives exposed by libraries like OpenSSL are not.

This approach makes NaCl a lot closer to a system like GPG than it is
to the cryptographic primitive APIs in a library like OpenSSL. In addition,
NaCl also uses state-of-the-art encryption, including Curve25519 elliptic
curves and the XSalsa20 stream cipher. This means with NaCl you not only get
a system which is designed to be secure-by-default, you also get one which
is extremely fast with comparatively small cryptographic keys.

For more information on NaCl's goals, see Dan Bernstein's presentation
[Blaming the Cryptographic User](http://cr.yp.to/talks/2012.08.08/slides.pdf)

## Supported platforms

You can use RbNaCl anywhere you can get libsodium installed (see below).
RbNaCl is continuously integration tested on the following Ruby VMs:

* MRI 1.8 / REE
* MRI 1.9 (YARV)
* JRuby 1.7 (in both 1.8/1.9 mode)
* Rubinius HEAD (in both 1.8/1.9 mode)

In theory Windows should be supported, although there are not yet any
reports of successful Windows users.

## Installation

RbNaCl is implemented as a Ruby FFI binding, which is designed to bind to
shared libraries. Unfortunately NaCl does not presently ship a shared library,
so RbNaCl cannot take advantage of it via FFI. RbNaCl will support usage with
the upstream NaCl once it is able to compile a shared library.

For now, to use RbNaCl, you will need to install libsodium, a portable version
of NaCl based upon the reference C code. Please see the libsodium project
for information regarding installation:

https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium

Once you have libsodium installed, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rbnacl'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rbnacl

## Usage

### Authenticated secret-key encryption: Crypto::SecretBox

Think of SecretBox like a safe: you can put information inside of
it, and anyone with the combination can open it.  Also, like any
high security safe, any attempts to tamper with the safe or its
contents will be detected.

``` ruby
# generate a secret key (or perhaps use scrypt or PBKDF2)
key = Crypto::Random.random_bytes(Crypto::SecretBox::KEYBYTES)

# initialize the box
crypto_secret_box = Crypto::SecretBox.new(key)

# encrypt a message using the box.
# First, make a nonce.  One simple strategy is to use 24 random bytes.
# The nonce isn't secret, and can be sent with the ciphertext.
nonce = Crypto::Random.random_bytes(24)
message = "..."
ciphertext = crypto_secret_box.box(nonce, message)
#=> "..." # string of random looking bytes, 16 bytes longer than message.
# The extra 16-bytes are the authenticator

# decrypt a message
# NB: Same nonce used here.
decrypted_message = crypto_secret_box.open(nonce, ciphertext)
#=> "..."

# But if the ciphertext has been tampered with:
crypto_secret_box.open(nonce, corrupted_ciphertext)
#=> Crypto::CryptoError exception is raised.
# Chosen ciphertext attacks are prevented by authentication and constant-time comparisons
```

#### Important Usage Notes

* **What the algorithm does for you**: ensures data is kept confidential and
  that it cannot be undetectably modified by an attacker
* **What the algorithm expects from you**: a secret key which must be kept
  confidential, and a unique ("nonce") value each time the SecretBox function
  is used. The SecretBox function must never ever be called with the same
  key:nonce pair!
* **What happens if you reuse a nonce**: ALL IS LOST! complete loss of the
  confidentiality of your data (provided nonces are reused with the same key).
  Do ***NOT*** let this happen or you are breaking the security of your system

#### Algorithm details:
* **Encryption**: XSalsa20 stream cipher
* **Authentication**: Poly1305 one-time MAC

### Authenticated public-key encryption: Crypto::Box

Box works similarly to GPG: anyone can publish a public key, and
if you have someone's public key, you can put messages into the
box, but once closed, only the holder of the private key can open it.
However, unlike GPG, the box is defined by two pairs of keys (yours and
theirs) so they need your public key to open the box, too. By checking
both sets of keys, you're assured the box came from who you were expecting
and that it has not been tampered with. This bidirectional guarantee
around identity is known as [mutual authentication][mutualauth].

[mutualauth]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication

``` ruby
# generate a private key
private_key = Crypto::PrivateKey.generate

# send the public key to someone (or everyone)
public_key  = private_key.public_key

# initialize the box
crypto_box = Crypto::Box.new(someones_public_key, private_key)
# the other person does this with your key
crypto_box = Crypto::Box.new(public_key, someones_private_key)
# on sending or receiving the first message, the shared key is derived.

# encrypt a message using the box.
# First, make a nonce.  One simple strategy is to use 24 random bytes.
# The nonce isn't secret, and can be sent with the ciphertext.
nonce = Crypto::Random.random_bytes(24)
message = "..."
ciphertext = crypto_box.box(nonce, message)
#=> "..." # string of random looking bytes, 16 bytes longer than message.
# The extra 16-bytes are the authenticator

# decrypt a message
# NB: Same nonce used here.
decrypted_message = crypto_box.open(nonce, ciphertext)
#=> "..."

# But if the ciphertext has been tampered with:
crypto_box.open(nonce, corrupted_ciphertext)
#=> Crypto::CryptoError exception is raised.
# Chosen ciphertext attacks are prevented by authentication and constant-time comparisons
```

#### Important Usage Notes

* **What the algorithm does for you**: ensures data is kept confidential and
  that it cannot be undetectably modified by an attacker, but can be decrypted
  by both of the private key holders.
* **What the algorithm expects from you**: a private key which must be kept
  confidential, a public key from someone else and a unique ("nonce") value each
  time the Box function is used by **either** party. The Box function must never
  ever be called with the same key:nonce pair!
* **What happens if you reuse a nonce**: ALL IS LOST! complete loss of the
  confidentiality of your data (provided nonces are reused with the same key).
  Do ***NOT*** let this happen or you are breaking the security of your system.

#### Algorithm details:
* **Encryption**: XSalsa20 stream cipher
* **Authentication**: Poly1305 one-time MAC
* **Public Keys**: Curve25519 elliptic curves

### Digital signatures: Crypto::SigningKey/Crypto::VerifyKey

In the real world, signatures help uniquely identify people because
everyone's signature is unique. Digital signatures work similarly in
that they are unique to holders of a private key, but unlike real
world signatures, digital signatures are unforgable.

Digital signatures allow you to publish a public key, then you can
use your private signing key to sign messages. Others who have your
public key can then use it to validate that your messages are actually
authentic.

#### Signer's perspective (Crypto::SigningKey):

```ruby
# Generate a new random signing key
signing_key = Crypto::SigningKey.generate

# Sign a message with the signing key
# Signature will be returned in hex format
signature = signing_key.sign(message, :hex)

# Obtain the verify key for a given signing key
verify_key = signing_key.verify_key

# Serialize the verify key to send it to a third party
# Verify key will be returned in hex format
verify_key.to_s(:hex)
```

#### Verifier's perspective (Crypto::VerifyKey):

```ruby
# Create a VerifyKey object from a hex serialized public key
verify_key = Crypto::VerifyKey.new(verify_key_hex, :hex)

# Check the validity of a message's signature
# Will raise Crypto::BadSignatureError if the signature check fails
verify_key.verify!(message, signature, :hex)
```

#### Algorithm features:

* **Small keys**: Ed25519 keys are only 256-bits (32 bytes), making them
  small enough to easily copy around. Ed25519 also allows the public key
  to be derived from the private key, meaning that it doesn't need to be
  included in a serialized private key in cases you want both.
* **Small signatures**: Ed25519 signatures are only 512-bits (64 bytes),
  one of the smallest signature sizes available.
* **Deterministic**: Unlike (EC)DSA, Ed25519 does not rely on an entropy
  source when signing messages, but instead computes signature nonces from
  a combination of a hash of the signing key's "seed" and the message to
  be signed. This avoids using an entropy source for nonces, which can be
  a potential attack vector if the entropy source is not generating good
  random numbers. Even a single reused nonce can lead to a complete disclosure
  of the private key in these schemes, which Ed25519 avoids entirely by being
  deterministic instead of tied to an entropy source.
* **Collision Resistant**: Hash-function collisions do not break this
  system. This adds a layer of defense against the possibility of weakness
  in the selected hash function.

#### Algorithm details:
* **Public Keys**: Curve25519 elliptic curves
* **Signatures**: Ed25519 signature system

### Authenticators

TODO: Write Authenticator instructions here

### Hash functions

Cryptographic hash functions compute a fixed length string, the message digest.
Even a small change in the input data should produce a large change in the
digest, and it is 'very difficult' to create two messages with the same digest.

A cryptographic hash can be used for checking the integrity of data, but there
is no secret involved in the hashing, so anyone can create the hash of a given
message.

``` ruby
# compute the SHA-256 digest of the message.
Crypto::Hash.sha256(message)
#=> "..." # a string of bytes.

# compute the SHA-512 digest of the message and hex-encode it.
Crypto::Hash.sha512(message, :hex)
#=> "ab67..." # a string of hexidecimal bytes.
```

#### Algorithm Details

* **SHA-256** and **SHA-512**

### Encoding system: Crypto::Encoder

RbNaCl supports a simple pluggable system for serializing messages in different
string encoding formats. Formats are identified as symbols and are typically
passed as the last argument to functions dealing with instantiating keys,
encrypting/decrypting, or signing messages.

For example, you can generate a `Crypto::SigningKey` and serialize it as hex:

```ruby
hex_key = Crypto::SigningKey.generate.to_s(:hex)
```

Then you can later decode it from hex:

```ruby
signing_key = Crypto::SigningKey.new(hex_key, :hex)
```

All components throughout RbNaCl are able to input and output both keys and
ciphertexts in a variety of encodings using this system.

The following formats are built-in:

* **:raw**: serialization as raw bytes with no additional string encoding
* **:hex**: serializes bytes as hexadecimal. Commonly used but relatively long
* **:base32**: (requires the base32 gem) URL-safe and relatively compact
* **:base64**: highly compact but not URL-safe

Below is an example of how to define an encoder. This is a hex encoder:

```ruby
class HexEncoder < Crypto::Encoder
  register :hex

  # Encode a message as hexadecimal
  def encode(bytes)
    bytes.to_s.unpack("H*").first
  end

  # Decode a message from hexadecimal
  def decode(hex)
    [hex.to_s].pack("H*")
  end
end
```

#### Base32 support

Base32 encoding is pretty neat! It's relatively compact, easy on the eyes,
and URL-safe! A serialized Base32 key looks like this:

`txga6qsakmupaibzbout62qpsk647qwdn22fo73wte52pzgvvsya`

To use Base32, add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rbnacl'
gem 'base32'
```

And require the following in your project:

```ruby
require 'rbnacl'
require 'rbnacl/encoders/base32'
```

### Utilities

There are some helpful functions for performing common tasks in cryptography.  These include random data generation (for example, for key material) using the operating system random source and constant-time comparisons of strings, to avoid exposing information through timing attacks.

``` ruby
# random strings
Crypto::Random.random_bytes(32)
#=> 32 bytes of randomness, from the OS

# constant time comparisons.
Crypto::Util.verify32(string_one, string_two)
#=> true/false.  See also verify16 
```

### Scalar multiplication

![Here be DRAGONS](https://raw.github.com/cryptosphere/rbnacl/master/dragons.png)

**WARNING**: Power-user feature. Not for the faint-at-heart.

Scalars provide direct access to the high-speed elliptic curve cryptography
(Curve25519) available in NaCl. It's a cryptographic power tool probably not
for the consumption of mere mortals like most of the rest of what's provided
in NaCl.

There are a few interesting use cases you may consider using the scalar
multiplication API for though:

#### Calculating public keys from private keys

**Note:** this functionality is already provided at a high level using the
`Crypto::PrivateKey#public_key` and `Crypto::SigningKey#verify_key` methods.

Unlike systems like RSA where keys must always be stored in keypairs,
NaCl allows you to store only the private key, and in cases where you
would like the corresponding public key, you can use the scalar
multiplication API to calculate it for you:

```ruby
public_key_bytes = Crypto::Scalar.mult_base(private_key_bytes)
```


#### Diffie-Hellman

**Note:** this functionality is already provided at a high level using the
`Crypto::Box` class.  This class also provides a mechanism for exchanging
encrypted and authenticated messages.


The scalar multiplication function can be used as part of a
[Diffie-Hellman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)
key exchange in which a shared session key is computed from an exchange of
public keys.

For example, Alice and Bob want to set up a shared private secret
(e.g. a session key for a cryptographic transport protocol)

Alice and Bob exchange public keys. Alice can now compute a
shared secret with:

```ruby
shared_secret = Crypto::Scalar.mult(alice_private_key, bob_public_key)
```

Bob can likewise compute the same shared secret with:

```ruby
shared_secret = Crypto::Scalar.mult(bob_private_key, alice_public_key)
```

Together Alice and Bob have now set up a shared secret that can be used
to set up a session key (e.g. by combining the shared secret value and an
agreed upon nonce using an algorithm like HKDF)


## Security Notes

NaCl itself has been expertly crafted to avoid a whole range of
side-channel attacks, however the RbNaCl code itself has not been
written with the same degree of expertise. While the code is
straightforward it should be considered experimental until audited
by professional cryptographers.

That said, it's probably still a million times better than OpenSSL...

## Learn More

While NaCl has designed to be easier-than-usual to use for a crypto
library, cryptography is an incredibly difficult subject and it's
always helpful to know as much as you can about it before applying
it to a particular use case. That said, the creator of NaCl, Dan
Bernstein, has published a number of papers about NaCl. If you are
interested in learning more about how NaCl works, it's recommended
that you read them:
